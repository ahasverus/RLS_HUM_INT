The database and how it was created are fully described in: Boyce D.G., et al. 2022. A climate risk index for marine life. Nature Climate Change. 
Tables S1 and S2 describe the indices and data sources that were used to calculate climate risk indices, and all associated metadata. Table S4 lists 
the thresholds that are used to calculate the climate risk categories and their justification. 
The columns in the database are as follows:

Spname: Species latin name.
Kingdom: Taxonomic kingdom.
Phylum: Taxnonomic phylum.
Family: Taxonomic family.
Comname: Common name.
ClimSens: Average climate sensitivity within species native geographic range.
ClimSensSD: Standard deviation of climate sensitivity within species native geographic range.
ClimExpo: Average climate exposure within species native geographic range.
ClimExpoSD: Standard deviation of climate exposure within species native geographic range.
ClimAdapt: Average climate adaptivity within species native geographic range.
ClimAdaptSD: Standard deviation of climate adaptivity within species native geographic range.
ClimVuln: Average climate vulnerability within species native geographic range.
ClimVulnSd: Standard deviation of climate vulnerability within species native geographic range.
ClimSensRisk: Average climate sensitivity risk within species native geographic range. N='negligible', M='moderate', H='high', C='critical'.
ClimExpoRisk: Average climate exposure risk within species native geographic range. N='negligible', M='moderate', H='high', C='critical'.
ClimAdaptRisk: Average climate adaptivity risk within species native geographic range. N='negligible', M='moderate', H='high', C='critical'.
